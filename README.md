The goal for this site was to create a good foundation for future development of a personal portfolio. 
It includes a homepage. an about me section, portfolio of work done and working towards, and a contact form. 
This site is by no means done but I hope it will provide me with a good starting point to develop a truly interactive and user friendly personal portfolio site.
